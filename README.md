## Beliefs, Reality, and Mastery

### Introduction
It doesn’t matter what is true; only what you believe is true—because, with enough effort, those beliefs will become true. Your thoughts create your beliefs, and your beliefs (**বিশ্বাস**) become your reality (**বাস্তবতা**). The universal theory of everything and the master algorithm of evolution (**ক্রমবিকাশ**) is:

**Beliefs > Actions > Results > Feedback**

You must intercept your own algorithm at the **beliefs** stage, take massive action based on those new beliefs, experience the results, listen to the feedback, and then iterate your beliefs and actions again and again—each time refining the process.

### Personal Responsibility
Where you are in life—your current situation—is all your doing. You built yourself and your life. You are solely responsible for where you are now and where you will be in the future. There is no external force (**শক্তি**), person, or thing working against you—it’s all you.

### Beyond Physical Boundaries
We are not just physical bodies bound to Earth by gravity (**ভার**) with a hopeless existence. We are the evolution of light—a waveform experiencing (**অভিজ্ঞতা**) consciousness (**উপলব্ধি**). What we perceive as reality is simply a magnificent (**মহৎ**) illusion (**মায়া**). We create our own realities through our thoughts, beliefs, and actions. The best way to live life is to evolve (**প্রকাশ**) yourself and achieve whatever you want—to become whoever you want to be.

### Standards vs. Dreams
We are not the highest version of ourselves that we can imagine; we are the lowest version that we are willing to accept. Understand that you will do nothing to achieve your dreams but fight like hell to not breach your standards (**মান**). If you want to achieve your dreams and goals, you must turn them into **irrefutable** (**অকাট্য**) standards.

### Awareness of Patterns
Be constantly (**ক্রমাগত**) aware of your own patterns of existence. As humans, we are constantly in conflict between who we are now and who we want to become. These two selves are often at odds with each other, creating a waveform (**তরঙ্গরূপ**) pattern of highs and lows. Pay attention to these highs and lows, and look for signs to help you catch yourself and correct your course.

### Facing Light and Darkness
The key to all evolution (**ক্রমবিকাশ**) is **variation** (**প্রকরণ**). When you grow tired of what is in the light, you must face what is in the dark. We need to understand the dualism (**দ্বৈতবাদ**) that exists within our minds and move beyond the binary (**দুইভাগবিশিষ্ট**) view of right and wrong, true self and false self. Nothing is static (**স্থির**), and everything in the universe is always becoming. The real question is: **“Who am I becoming?”** (**আমি কে হয়ে উঠছি?**)

### The Power of Beliefs
Our minds operate like an on/off system that is programmed over time to believe certain things. Our experience of reality is simply the result of those beliefs. When we experience or think of something, we add a “rock” to a particular set of scales—positive or negative. Each belief is a scale, and whichever side has the most rocks becomes what we believe. **What we believe becomes our reality**.

### Mental Feedback Loops
Be constantly aware of **mental feedback loops**. What you think about is what you keep thinking about—a circular relationship where cause creates effect, and effect feeds back into cause, forming a **self-fulfilling** (**আত্মবাচক**) cycle. Mental feedback (**প্রতিক্রিয়া**) loops can either build you up to greatness or break you down until you consider giving up. Make sure to catch the negative cycles and feed the positive ones.

### Defining Your Character
Many people's characters have become so rigid that they control their own master. You must pin down your character, define who it is, what it’s capable of, and decide whether it aligns with your true goals. If the character isn’t suitable for the job, it's time to design one who will succeed. Your character is **changeable**, and you have the power to pull the strings.

### Freedom from Judgment
If you judge others, you won't be able to do anything special because you’ll be afraid of being judged. You won’t step out of your comfort zone for fear of what others might think. People who judge others are often revealing what they’re trying to hide themselves. They show their cards without realizing it. Simply watch, have fun, and don't get caught up. The only way to be free from the fear of judgment is to stop judging others. Let go of opinions about others, and you’ll be free to do whatever you want.

### Conclusion
Your beliefs shape your actions, and your actions create your reality. By continually evolving your beliefs, taking deliberate actions, and focusing on growth, you can create the life you want. Take charge of your thoughts, let go of judgment, and become the person you want to be.
