# FHB - THE NORTH STAR üí´ PARADIGM
Know Thyself...

As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.

Nothing is good or bad, thinking makes it. What if I am just dreaming.?

Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.

## Important things to remember for the rest of your life.
### MASTER ALGORITHM OF LIFE
It doesn‚Äôt matter what is true; only what you believe is true‚Äîbecause, with enough effort, those beliefs will become true. Your thoughts create your beliefs, and your beliefs (**‡¶¨‡¶ø‡¶∂‡ßç‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶∏**) become your reality (**‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶§‡¶¨‡¶§‡¶æ**). The universal theory of everything and the master algorithm of evolution (**‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶Æ‡¶¨‡¶ø‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶∂**) is:

**Beliefs > Actions > Results > Feedback**

You must intercept your own algorithm at the **beliefs** stage, take massive action based on those new beliefs, experience the results, listen to the feedback, and then iterate your beliefs and actions again and again‚Äîeach time refining the process.

### Personal Responsibility
Where you are in life‚Äîyour current situation‚Äîis all your doing. You built yourself and your life. You are solely responsible for where you are now and where you will be in the future. There is no external force (**‡¶∂‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶§‡¶ø**), person, or thing working against you‚Äîit‚Äôs all you.

### Beyond Physical Boundaries
We are not just physical bodies bound to Earth by gravity (**‡¶≠‡¶æ‡¶∞**) with a hopeless existence. We are the evolution of light‚Äîa waveform experiencing (**‡¶Ö‡¶≠‡¶ø‡¶ú‡ßç‡¶û‡¶§‡¶æ**) consciousness (**‡¶â‡¶™‡¶≤‡¶¨‡ßç‡¶ß‡¶ø**). What we perceive as reality is simply a magnificent (**‡¶Æ‡¶π‡ßé**) illusion (**‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶Ø‡¶º‡¶æ**). We create our own realities through our thoughts, beliefs, and actions. The best way to live life is to evolve (**‡¶™‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶∂**) yourself and achieve whatever you want‚Äîto become whoever you want to be.

### Standards vs. Dreams
We are not the highest version of ourselves that we can imagine; we are the lowest version that we are willing to accept. Understand that you will do nothing to achieve your dreams but fight like hell to not breach your standards (**‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶®**). If you want to achieve your dreams and goals, you must turn them into **irrefutable** (**‡¶Ö‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶ü‡ßç‡¶Ø**) standards.

### Awareness of Patterns
Be constantly (**‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶ó‡¶§**) aware of your own patterns of existence. As humans, we are constantly in conflict between who we are now and who we want to become. These two selves are often at odds with each other, creating a waveform (**‡¶§‡¶∞‡¶ô‡ßç‡¶ó‡¶∞‡ßÇ‡¶™**) pattern of highs and lows. Pay attention to these highs and lows, and look for signs to help you catch yourself and correct your course.

### Facing Light and Darkness
The key to all evolution (**‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶Æ‡¶¨‡¶ø‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶∂**) is **variation** (**‡¶™‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶ï‡¶∞‡¶£**). When you grow tired of what is in the light, you must face what is in the dark. We need to understand the dualism (**‡¶¶‡ßç‡¶¨‡ßà‡¶§‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶¶**) that exists within our minds and move beyond the binary (**‡¶¶‡ßÅ‡¶á‡¶≠‡¶æ‡¶ó‡¶¨‡¶ø‡¶∂‡¶ø‡¶∑‡ßç‡¶ü**) view of right and wrong, true self and false self. Nothing is static (**‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶•‡¶ø‡¶∞**), and everything in the universe is always becoming. The real question is: **‚ÄúWho am I becoming?‚Äù** (**‡¶Ü‡¶Æ‡¶ø ‡¶ï‡ßá ‡¶π‡¶Ø‡¶º‡ßá ‡¶â‡¶†‡¶õ‡¶ø?**)

### The Power of Beliefs
Our minds operate like an on/off system that is programmed over time to believe certain things. Our experience of reality is simply the result of those beliefs. When we experience or think of something, we add a ‚Äúrock‚Äù to a particular set of scales‚Äîpositive or negative. Each belief is a scale, and whichever side has the most rocks becomes what we believe. **What we believe becomes our reality**.

### Mental Feedback Loops
Be constantly aware of **mental feedback loops**. What you think about is what you keep thinking about‚Äîa circular relationship where cause creates effect, and effect feeds back into cause, forming a **self-fulfilling** (**‡¶Ü‡¶§‡ßç‡¶Æ‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶ö‡¶ï**) cycle. Mental feedback (**‡¶™‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶§‡¶ø‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶ø‡¶Ø‡¶º‡¶æ**) loops can either build you up to greatness or break you down until you consider giving up. Make sure to catch the negative cycles and feed the positive ones.

### Defining Your Character
Many people's characters have become so rigid that they control their own master. You must pin down your character, define who it is, what it‚Äôs capable of, and decide whether it aligns with your true goals. If the character isn‚Äôt suitable for the job, it's time to design one who will succeed. Your character is **changeable**, and you have the power to pull the strings.

### Freedom from Judgment
If you judge others, you won't be able to do anything special because you‚Äôll be afraid of being judged. You won‚Äôt step out of your comfort zone for fear of what others might think. People who judge others are often revealing what they‚Äôre trying to hide themselves. They show their cards without realizing it. Simply watch, have fun, and don't get caught up. The only way to be free from the fear of judgment is to stop judging others. Let go of opinions about others, and you‚Äôll be free to do whatever you want.

### Conclusion
Your beliefs shape your actions, and your actions create your reality. By continually evolving your beliefs, taking deliberate actions, and focusing on growth, you can create the life you want. Take charge of your thoughts, let go of judgment, and become the person you want to be.
